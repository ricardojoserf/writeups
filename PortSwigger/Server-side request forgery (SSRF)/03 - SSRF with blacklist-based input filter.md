
# SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.

There is a button to check the stock:

It generates this POST request:

The stockApi parameter contains the url “http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check?productId=1&storeId=1”, and we can tryo to change it to other url:

It seems we can not use “http://127.0.0.1” or “http://localhost/”:

Using http://017700000001/ the error changes:

Using http://127.1 we can access the local server, for example we can access /login. But we still can not access /admin, it gets detected.

Using case variation, using ADMIN in uppercase, it is possible to access /admin:

From the source code we find it is possible to delete the user with a GET request with a payload like this:

```
POST /product/stock HTTP/2
...

stockApi=http://127.1/ADMIN/delete?username=carlos
```
