
# Basic SSRF against another back-end system

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.X range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user carlos.

It seems it is possible to delete users with a GET request from the response:

We will add this to the request:
