
# DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the submit feedback page. It uses the jQuery library's $ selector function to find an anchor element, and changes its href attribute using data from location.search.

To solve this lab, make the "back" link alert document.cookie.

And the url of the "Submit Feedback" page is https://0af5007903b0426b803b4e9100cb0023.web-security-academy.net/feedback?returnPath=/:

It is possible to use a Javascript url like:

```
/feedback?returnPath=javascript:alert(document.cookie)
```
