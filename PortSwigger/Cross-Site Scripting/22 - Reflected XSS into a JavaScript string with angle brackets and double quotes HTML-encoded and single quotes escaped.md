
# Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes escaped

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets and double are HTML encoded and single quotes are escaped.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.

The content of the search is reflected inside a h1 HTML element and a variable in Javascript with single quotes:

Single quote is escaped and “<”, ">" and ‘"’ are HTML-encoded:

A payload that works is:

```
\';alert(1);//
```
