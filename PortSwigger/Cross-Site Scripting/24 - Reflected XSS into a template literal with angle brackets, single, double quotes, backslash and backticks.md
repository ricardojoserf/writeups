
# Reflected XSS into a template literal with angle brackets, single, double quotes, backslash and backticks

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. The reflection occurs inside a template string with angle brackets, single, and double quotes HTML encoded, and backticks escaped. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function inside the template string.

The content of the search is reflected inside the variable “message”, a template literal:

We can execute this payload inside the template literal:

```
${alert(1)}
```
