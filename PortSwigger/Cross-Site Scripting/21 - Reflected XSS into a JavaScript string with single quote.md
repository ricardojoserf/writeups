
# Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote 

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string with single quotes and backslashes escaped.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.

I used the payload:

```
';</script><img src=x onerror=alert(1)><script>var a='a
```
