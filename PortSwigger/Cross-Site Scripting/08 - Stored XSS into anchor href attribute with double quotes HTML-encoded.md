It is possible to post comments:



![img](images/Stored%20XSS%20into%20anchor%20href%20attribute%20with%20double%20quotes%20HTML-encoded/2.png)

This is the HTML element generated:



![img](images/Stored%20XSS%20into%20anchor%20href%20attribute%20with%20double%20quotes%20HTML-encoded/3.png)


When the user name is clicked, it redirects to the website set in the comment:





![img](images/Stored%20XSS%20into%20anchor%20href%20attribute%20with%20double%20quotes%20HTML-encoded/4.png)

We will set the website to a javascript url:

```
javascript:alert(1)
```

When clicked, the alert pops:
