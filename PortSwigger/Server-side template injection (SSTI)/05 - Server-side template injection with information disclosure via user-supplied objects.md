This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the way an object is being passed into the template. This vulnerability can be exploited to access sensitive data.

To solve the lab, steal and submit the framework's secret key.

It is possible to edit the templates of the posts:

We find there are values calculated with the format "${product.X}":

Trying to add the payload “{{3*3}}” generates the following stack trace:

Knowing it uses a Django template we can leak debug information with the payload:

```
{% debug %}
```

There is an element “settings” in Django of type UserSettingsHolder:

```
{{settings}}
```

It contains a SECRET_KEY field:

```
{{settings.SECRET_KEY}}
```
