
# Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
