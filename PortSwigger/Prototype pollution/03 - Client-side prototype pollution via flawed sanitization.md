
# Client-side prototype pollution via flawed sanitization

This lab is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. Although the developers have implemented measures to prevent prototype pollution, these can be easily bypassed.

To solve the lab:

Find a source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype.

Identify a gadget property that allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

Combine these to call alert().

There are two scripts imported in the home page:

This is “/resources/js/searchLoggerFiltered.js”. It suffers the same problem that one previous lab with “transport_url”:

Knowing the sanitization from the santizeKey() function, we can try a payload like:

```
/?__pro__proto__to__[transport_url]=bar
```

And the value in Object.prototype is correct:

Finally:

```
/?__pro__proto__to__[transport_url]=data:,alert(1);
```
