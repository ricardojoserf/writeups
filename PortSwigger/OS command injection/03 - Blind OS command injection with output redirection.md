
# Blind OS command injection with output redirection

This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response. However, you can use output redirection to capture the output from the command. There is a writable folder at /var/www/images/.

The application serves the images for the product catalog from this location. You can redirect the output from the injected command to a file in this folder, and then use the image loading URL to retrieve the contents of the file.

To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and retrieve the output.

There is a functionality for submitting feedback:



![img](images/Blind%20OS%20command%20injection%20with%20output%20redirection/2.png)

And the images are retrieved with a GET request:

We need to execute:

```
whoami > /var/www/images/whoami.txt
```

I sent the POST request to intruder and set 3 fields to attack in Sniper mode:



![img](images/Blind%20OS%20command%20injection%20with%20output%20redirection/4.png)

Then I added 3 payloads:



![img](images/Blind%20OS%20command%20injection%20with%20output%20redirection/5.png)

When we add payloads to the field subject the website returns an error:



![img](images/Blind%20OS%20command%20injection%20with%20output%20redirection/6.png)

We get the username “peter-5fYwD0” after a GET to "/image?filename=whoami.txt", so the intruder attack worked:
