
# JWT authentication bypass via flawed signature verification

This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server is insecurely configured to accept unsigned JWTs.

To solve the lab, modify your session token to gain access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

Tip: We recommend familiarizing yourself with how to work with JWTs in Burp Suite before attempting this lab.

Then delete everything after the second “.” character (that is the signature):
