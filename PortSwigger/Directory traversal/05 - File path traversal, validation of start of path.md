
# File path traversal, validation of start of path

This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application transmits the full file path via a request parameter, and validates that the supplied path starts with the expected folder.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

To retrieve an image the application uses a GET request with the parameter filename and the full path:

To retrieve /etc/passwd we need the path to start with “/var/www/images/”:

```
GET /image?filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd 
```
