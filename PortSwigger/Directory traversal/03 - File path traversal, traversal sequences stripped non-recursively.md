
# 14 - File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application strips path traversal sequences from the user-supplied filename before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
