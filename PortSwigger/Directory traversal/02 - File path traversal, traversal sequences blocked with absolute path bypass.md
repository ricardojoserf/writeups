
# File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

To retrieve an image the application uses a GET request with the parameter filename:

To retrieve /etc/passwd:

```
GET /image?filename=/etc/passwd 
```
