Login process is a POST request:



![img](images/User%20role%20can%20be%20modified%20in%20user%20profile/2.png)


It responds with a 302 redirect:

There is a function to update the email address with a POST request:



![img](images/User%20role%20can%20be%20modified%20in%20user%20profile/4.png)


It responds with the personal information:



![img](images/User%20role%20can%20be%20modified%20in%20user%20profile/5.png)


We can add the roleid parameter to the POST request to change the role of the user:

```
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/2
...

{"email":"test@test.com", "roleid":2}
```



![img](images/User%20role%20can%20be%20modified%20in%20user%20profile/6.png)


It is updated:



![img](images/User%20role%20can%20be%20modified%20in%20user%20profile/7.png)


Then we can delete the user:
