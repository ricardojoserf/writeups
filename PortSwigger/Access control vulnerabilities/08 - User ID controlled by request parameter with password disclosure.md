Clicking the “Home” button generates this GET request:



![img](images/User%20ID%20controlled%20by%20request%20parameter%20with%20password%20disclosure/2.png)


We can change the id to “administrator”:

Then I changed the type to “text”:



![img](images/User%20ID%20controlled%20by%20request%20parameter%20with%20password%20disclosure/4.png)


And delete the user:
